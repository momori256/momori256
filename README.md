### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Momori, a software engineer with C++, Rust, and SQL expertise in Vancouver, Canada.

I graduated from a university in Japan and embarked on my engineering journey at a video game company. There, I honed my skills in C++, SQL, and C#, essential for my primary role in developing a version management system for digital assets - think of it as Git and GitHub for images, sounds, or 3D models.

This experience underscores the importance of taking ownership and delving into technologies. My recent focus has been on Rust, which aligns with my passion for learning low-layer and functional programming.

I live in Vancouver and am currently seeking new opportunities here.

I actively share my knowledge, learning, or insights on tech matters through [my tech blog](https://momori-nakano.hashnode.dev/).
